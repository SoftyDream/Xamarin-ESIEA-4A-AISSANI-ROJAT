REAMDE

Before installing our solution, earmark that you'll need to install NuGet Package called "Microsoft.Net.Compilers".

If you are getting trouble after this fix, try those steps :

1) Stop running/debugging your project.
2) Clear \obj and \bin folders (remove their content)
3) Run the application as Debug, then in Release mode (it'll generate new content for the previous folders)
4) Then, re-run as Debug.

Have fun !
